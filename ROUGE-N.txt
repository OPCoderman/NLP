ROUGE

ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)

ROUGE-N measures the number of matching n-grams between the model-generated text and a human-produced reference. it is a metric and a software package specifically designed for evaluating automatic summarization, but that can be also used for machine translation. The metrics compare an automatically produced summary or translation against reference (high-quality and human-produced) summaries or translations.

Pros and Cons of ROUGE
Pros: it correlates positively with human evaluation, itâ€™s inexpensive to compute and language-independent.
Cons: ROUGE does not manage different words that have the same meaning, as it measures syntactical matches rather than semantics.
