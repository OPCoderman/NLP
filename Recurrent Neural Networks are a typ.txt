Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network designed for sequential data, such as time series, speech, or text. Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs have loops that allow information to persist, giving them a form of memory. This makes them well-suited for tasks like language modeling, machine translation, and sequence prediction. However, standard RNNs struggle with long sequences due to vanishing or exploding gradients, which has led to more advanced variants like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units).
