Attention Is All You Need

Prior to this, models like RNNs and LSTMs were dominant for handling sequential data, but they suffered from limited parallelism and difficulty modeling long-range dependencies. The Transformer addresses these issues by removing recurrence entirely and relying solely on attention mechanisms to process sequences.

this work presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on
attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.

For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, this achieved a new state of the art. In the former task the best model outperforms even all previously reported models.

The Transformer model enabled significant improvements in both training efficiency and performance, and it laid the foundation for many influential models that followed, including BERT and the GPT series. Its impact extends beyond language tasks into fields like computer vision, speech, and even biological data modeling, making it one of the most influential contributions to deep learning.
